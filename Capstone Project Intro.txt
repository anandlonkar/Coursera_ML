Introduction - Business problem
Where do I setup my next Montessori?
My sons Montessori school is in process of expanding to other areas. They already have presence in 2 zip codes within the Dallas Fort Worth metroplex and both are quite successful. Assuming that both the locations that they have share some common characteristics (demographic information, percentage of preschoolers, household income, presence of other day cares/schools nearby) I am trying to figure out the best zip code to setup a similar school in the 100 miles radius of my zipcode

Data Needed
I am looking for the following information
All Zip codes within 100 miles of my location - Data from https://www.zipcodestogo.com/lookups/radius-search.php
Census Data for each zip code - To find percentage of children under age of 5 in each areas, household income etc
Foursquare API - to find educational institutions in each of the zip codes

Methodology
Based on the above data for each of the zip codes, I want to find the optimum cluster which contains both the current locations. The other Zipcodes in this cluster will share same characteristics as the 2 that currently have the locations. If there are multiple zip codes in the same cluster apart from these 2 the winner will be selected on the highest number of preschoolers/Number of educational institutions ratio
